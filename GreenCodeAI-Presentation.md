# Greencode AI
## Sustainable Coding Powered by AI

## The Problem

* **AI's carbon footprint is massive**
  * Training a large AI model: **284 tonnes CO₂** (≈ 5× lifetime emissions of a car)
  * AI computation increased **300,000×** from 2012-2018 (Schwartz et al., 2019)

* **We face a dangerous multiplier effect**:
  * ➊ Training AI models consumes massive energy
  * ➋ These models generate inefficient code
  * ➌ This code runs on billions of devices globally
  * ➍ Cycle repeats with exponentially increasing emissions

* **No existing code AI addresses this problem**

## Our Mission

> **Empowering developers to reduce carbon emissions from software through AI-guided code efficiency**

* **Prevent** carbon-heavy code instead of offsetting after the fact
* **Educate** developers on sustainable coding practices
* **Measure** real environmental impact of code optimization
* **Improve** both existing codebases and new development

## Current Landscape: AI Code Tools

| Tool | Environmental Focus? | Model Transparency | Self-Hosting |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| GitHub Copilot | ❌ None | ❌ Closed | ❌ No |
| Amazon CodeWhisperer | ❌ None | ❌ Closed | ❌ No |
| Tabnine | ❌ None | ⚠️ Partial | ⚠️ Limited |
| Codeium | ❌ None | ❌ Closed | ❌ No |
| **Greencode AI** | ✅ **Primary focus** | ✅ **Fully open** | ✅ **Yes** |

All existing tools prioritize productivity, not sustainability
